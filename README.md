# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using machine learning techniques. The notebook is implemented in Google Colab and uses a dataset directly imported from the OpenML library to avoid manual CSV uploads.

## What I Did

- Imported the UCI Heart Disease dataset from OpenML 
- Renamed columns to match the format used on Kaggle for easier readability
- Checked for class imbalance in the target variable
- Visualized the distribution using bar and pie charts
- Ensured everything works smoothly without local dataset dependencies
- Applied appropriate algorithm and choosed the best.
- Analysed each column

## Why This Project?

The goal was to create a simple, reproducible pipeline that can be run entirely in Colab with no external file uploads, making it easier for others to try out and explore.

## If anything needed to be improved
